We note that because of the relu all of the elements in both $relu(x_1)$ and $relu(x_2)$ are positive, 
because of that the dot product $relu(x_1)^T relu(x_2)$ is composed of a sum of positive arguments, hence 
$$relu(x_1)^T relu(x_2) > 0.5$$
Now, we note that for every positive scalar $i$, it holds that $\sigma (i) > 0.5$. Hence, we arrive at the conclusion that the probability for every sample is
$$p(Paraphrases|x_1, x_2) = \sigma (relu(x_1)^T relu(x_2)) > 0.5$$
Assuming that our decision threshold is $0.5$ it holds that we predict True for every pair.
Hence, we predict correctly for True pairs and wrong for False pairs. Our accuracy is 
$$\frac{1}{1+3}=25 \% $$
