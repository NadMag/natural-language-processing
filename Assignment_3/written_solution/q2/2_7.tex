Let us note that the pretraining data contains the birthplace information about the individuals which are in the birth\_dev dataset. 
It seems that the model is able to "remember" the birthplace knowledge that it acquires during pretraining, and it is able to infer that knowledge during evaluation. 
Let us also note that the finetuning process does not make the model forget the knowledge it acquired during pretraining.
